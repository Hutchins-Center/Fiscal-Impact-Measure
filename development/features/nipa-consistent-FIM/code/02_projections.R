### 2.1.1 COLA Adjustments --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adjust federal transfers to feature their january COLA-related bump; reattribute that growth to calendar quarter 1
# before smoothing out the rest of the non-COLA related growth. SSA uses CPI-W to create COLAs; We use CBO's projection
# of CPI-U. This slightly affects the timing of total transfers, but not their levels
