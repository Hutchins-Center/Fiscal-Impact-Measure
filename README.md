# Fiscal-Impact-Measure
GitHub repository for the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure.

Open the Fiscal-Impact-Measure.Rpoj file in the parent directory of Fiscal-Impact-Measure to work on any R code. R projects are useful for ensuring that our code is reproducible as it saves us from having to setwd(~/...) explicitly. Once you open the project you'll have access to all the sub-directories by selecting the files tab in the environment pane. 

The project structure has been reorganized to remove clutter and make it easier to find things. For example, all the scattered folders from the 2020 updates are now in fim archive along with fim old and fim barometer archive.
